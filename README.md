# Cloud Technology Introduction

This project is a Cloud Technology Introduction webpage hosted on Amazon EC2, aimed at educating users about the fundamentals of cloud computing. It covers key concepts such as cloud types, service models, popular cloud tools, and benefits of cloud technology. Additionally, it provides useful YouTube links for users who want to dive deeper into learning cloud computing.

# Key Highlights:

HTML Page Hosted Using EC2:
The project consists of a simple HTML page that serves as an educational resource on cloud computing.
Hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance, which ensures high availability and scalability, allowing users to access the content globally.
File Transfer via SCP
The website files (HTML, CSS, images) were uploaded to the EC2 instance using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol), which ensures secure and reliable file transfers over SSH.

# Downloading Files with WGET:
WGET was used for downloading resources, including external images and assets, directly onto the EC2 instance for efficient setup.
Image and YouTube Integration
Images (cloud.png, cs.png, tools.webp, etc.) have been embedded into the page for a visually engaging experience.
Added YouTube links to cloud computing learning channels, such as TechWorld with Nana and freeCodeCamp, to give users access to more in-depth video tutorials.

# Technologies Used:
Amazon EC2 for hosting the HTML page.
HTML/CSS for creating and styling the web page.
SCP for securely transferring files to the EC2 instance.
WGET for downloading external resources.
YouTube API/links for embedding cloud computing tutorials.
